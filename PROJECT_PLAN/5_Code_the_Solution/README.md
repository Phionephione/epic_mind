# Task 5: Code the Solution

## Task Notes
Program the discussed solution. The code should be well-structured, clean, and performant.

## Deliverable
The full code (frontend + backend).

**Note:** The frontend code for this solution exists in the root directory of this project (`index.html`, `index.tsx`). This project is frontend-only and does not have a dedicated backend, as it communicates directly with the AI API and uses browser `localStorage` for storage.

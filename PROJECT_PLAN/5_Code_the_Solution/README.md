# Task 5: Code the Solution

## Task Notes
Program the discussed solution. The code should be well-structured, clean, and performant.

## Deliverable
The full code (frontend + backend).

**Note:** This project is frontend-only and does not have a dedicated backend, as it communicates directly with the AI API and uses browser `localStorage` for storage.
